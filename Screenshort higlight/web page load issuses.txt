directly highlighting content in an iframe from the parent page due to security restrictions imposed by the Same-Origin Policy (SOP).

it's not possible for your webpage to directly modify the content of another website hosted within an iframe due to security restrictions. This is called the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) and prevents potential malicious scripts from accessing 
and manipulating data across different domains

If you have control over the website being displayed in the iframe, you could potentially implement highlighting functionality directly within that website's code.
 This would involve JavaScript and CSS adjustments to target specific text based on user interaction or pre-defined parameters

highlighting text directly within an external iframe hosted on another domain is not feasible due to security restrictions. 

It's important to note that attempting to bypass security measures, such as cross-origin restrictions, X-Frame-Options, or Content Security Policy, can lead to security vulnerabilities and may violate the terms of service of the website in question.
 Bypassing these security measures without proper authorization is considered unethical and could have legal consequences.
